      <h2>Where I've worked</h2>
      <p>I've been at a few different companies now; they range from the very small (3 people, basement startup) to larger (450 people, multi-national, etc) organizations. I've found that the real advantage to the fewer people companies is the kinds of goofy comraderie that can be fostered amongst a small team.</p>
      <p>This is actually a good thing. It makes us enjoy going into work and therefore, enjoy our time at work. We can get through a lot as long as we know the guy next to us shares our pain.</p>
      <h2>Whom I've worked with</h2>
      <p>Because of the various places I've been able to work, I've been able to work with people who range from the really amazing super-star level to the 'who let this person near a compiler' level. The super stars generally all have a lot more fun.</p>
      <p>I think that's because the superstar level folks enjoy what they're doing. They have a deep seeded interest in what they're doing and they focus on the positive aspects of development. At one point, I got to work with someone who spent time working on a c++ compiler at Motorolla. He actually lit up while we talked about the various edge cases in optimizers that get solved.</p>
      <h2>Why I'm writing this down</h2>
      <p>Because I'm starting a new job. And supposedly, most people second guess their decision to change jobs within the first 8 hours. My reservations are pretty large:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>I'm taking a title downgrade (from Principal Engineer to Sr. Engineer) - I don't care as much about this</li>
          <li>I'm going to work for a very large company (7000+ employees)</li>
          <li>I'll be working with some of the most intelligent folks in the world</li>
          <li>The team is spread all over the world</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I'm just coming off an intense 1 1/2 year "burn-out" period. I've written some 170000+ lines of code in the last two years, architecting most of the Azimuth RNX platform application software (10k frames / second of some roughly 300000 'complex' operations - each frame needs to be done within 100 uSec).</p>
      <p>I got to work with some really great people. We had a lot of intense disagreements and technical challenges to meet, but at the end I think everyone on the development team there is amazing.</p>
      <p>So, going to work for RedHat, where the environment is quite different from any that I've worked in will be a big change; one that I'm nervous about. I hope I'll be able to deliver, and demonstrate my drive, passion, and enthusiasm for both open source, and software development. I guess we'll see.</p>
